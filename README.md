Ready to Cloud
==============

Imagine! Teleportation as we all know from Star Trek can be possible! Or even nearly. With the Ready to Cloud project we propose a first trial on simulating a teleportation system within the possibilites of off the shelf materials. The main idea came from a broad and deep observation on diegetic prototyping and narrative methods of communicating utopian visions.  The idea is to beam people realtime 3D-scans from one city to another, from one party to the next and by this creating an opportunity to set up a holographic display.
